# Oleveler

Title for Omics-leveler. Seems to deal with all omics data? No, only quantitive proteomics and transcriptomics.

The functions are desigend to be (mostly) directly callable from within jupyter notebook when imported as:

```python
from oleveler import *
```

(Thus one file)

Tested in jupyter lab only.

Please include `%matplotlib widget` to allow interactive plotting. However, with this the plots cannot be saved together with `.ipynb` file. The updated jupyterlab module `...` will deal with that problem. For now, if you want to save plots with `.ipynb`, please use `%matplotlib inline`.

## Dependencies

(INCOMPLETE)

- Python3
  - numpy pandas scipy rpy2 matplotlib scikit-learn BCBio
  - openpyxl # for xlsx read and write
- R
  - MSstats
  - DESeq2
  - apeglm # for lfc shrinkage

## TODO:

- \*DESeq2 will die when too many comparisons will run in the same R kernel. This often happens because each comparison consume to much memory and thus leads to memory surge. The problem happens within DESeq2 code that I am not able to solve. Possible solutions include force release memory of saved results; force restart R kernel within R code (python cannot do this) after certain comparisons.
